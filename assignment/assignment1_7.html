        Supervised learning is defined as when a model gets trained on a “Labelled Dataset”. Labelled datasets have both input and output parameters. In Supervised Learning algorithms learn to map points between inputs and correct outputs. It has both training and validation datasets labelled.</p>
    <p style="color:red;font-size: larger;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        Example: Consider a scenario where you have to build an image classifier to differentiate between cats and dogs. If you feed the datasets of dogs and cats labelled images to the algorithm, the machine will learn to classify between a dog or a cat from these labeled images. When we input new dog or cat images that it has never seen before, it will use the learned algorithms and predict whether it is a dog or a cat. This is how supervised learning works, and this is particularly an image classification.

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">There are two main categories of supervised learning that are mentioned below:</h2>
    <ul style="font-size:x-large;color:darkblue;" >
        <li>classification </li>
        <li>regression</li>
    </ul>
