    <p style="color:red;font-size: larger;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables algorithms to uncover hidden patterns within datasets, allowing them to make predictions on new, similar data without explicit programming for each task. Traditional machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict outputs, yielding actionable insights. This technology finds applications in diverse fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, and automating tasks.</p>

    <p style="color:red;font-size: larger;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">For instance, recommender systems use historical data to personalize suggestions. Netflix, for example, employs collaborative and content-based filtering to recommend movies and TV shows based on user viewing history, ratings, and genre preferences. Reinforcement learning further enhances these systems by enabling agents to make decisions based on environmental feedback, continually refining recommendations.Machine learningâ€™s impact extends to autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, enhancing their adaptability in dynamic environments. This approach marks a breakthrough where machines learn from data examples to generate accurate outcomes, closely intertwined with data mining and data science.</p>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Machine Learning works in the following manner:</h2>
    <ul style="font-size:large;color:darkmagenta;" >
        <li>Data Collection:Data is collected such as images, text, numerical data, etc.</li>
        <li>Data Preprocessing:Before feeding the data into the algorithm, it often needs to be preprocessed. </li>
        <li>Choosing a Model:Depending on the task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering), a suitable machine learning model is chosen. </li>
        <li>Training the Model:The selected model is trained using the training data. </li>
        <li>Evaluating the Model:Once trained, the model is evaluated using the test data to assess its performance.</li>
        <li> Fine-tuning:Models may be fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters parameters that are not directly learned during training</li>
        <li>Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions or decisions on new data. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Types of Machine Learning :</h2>
