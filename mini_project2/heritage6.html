    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Soaring to a height
        of around 820 metres, the captivating Raigad Fort is perched on the Sahyadri mountain range in Mahad,
        Maharashtra. The majestic fort is accessible only from one side through a pathway which has about 1737 steps as
        deep valleys surround the other three sides. Alternatively, one can take the ropeway to reach the fort top in 4
        minutes.

        The fort is of great pride for the Marathas and is a reminder of the bravery and audacity. The Raigad fort is
        not just a tourist spot; it is a sacred place of pilgrimage which holds the imprints of the grand vision of
        Hindavi Swarajya as cherished by Chhatrapati Shivaji. While most of its parts are in ruins now, the fort still
        boasts of the brave history of Marathas.

        After capturing the Raigad Fort, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj renovated and named it as the capital of Maratha
        kingdom. The Britishers named it as the Gibraltar of the East as this well-fortified structure atop a hill had
        defied various attackers. It has several beguiling gates Nagarkhana Darwaja, Mena Darwaja, Maha Darwaja and
        Palkhi Darwaja. There was also a statue of Shivaji erected in front of the ruins of the main market avenue that
        eventually leads to his own Samadhi and that of his beloved dog.

    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">TThe Raigad Fort
        (earlier called as the Fort of Rairi) was seized by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1656 from Chandraraoji More,
        the King of Jawali. After Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj seized the fort, he expanded it considerably and named it
        as King’s Fort or Raigad. It later became the capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s expanding Maratha Empire.
        The Raigadwadi and Pachad villages are nestled at the base of the fort. These villages were vital during the
        Maratha reign at the Raigad Fort. The climb till the top of the fort starts right from Pachad itself. During the
        rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , a 10,000-strong cavalry division was always on guard at the Pachad
        village. Shivaji also built the Lingana Fort approximately two miles away from Raigad. It was used for
        accommodating prisoners.

        Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad in 1689 and Aurangzeb changed its name to Islamgad. Siddi Fathekan captured the
        fort in 1707 and held it until 1733. After this period, the Marathas captured the Raigad Fort once again and
        kept it till 1818. The Fort is nestled in the current Sindhudurg District of Maharashtra and the British East
        India Company targeted it as a major political epicenter. Cannons from the hill of Kalkai ravaged the Raigad
        Fort in 1818, destroying it. On May 9, 1818, a treaty was executed and the British East India Company obtained
        control of the same.</p>
