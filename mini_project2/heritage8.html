    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Murud jinjira fort, Murud</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The fort, last
        revamped at the end of 17th century, still has most of its significant fortifications standing intact except a
        few ruins inside. The main attractions of the magnificent fort are the three colossal canons called Kalal
        Bangadi, Chavri and Landa Kasam. Once it stood firm and robust in defence with 572 roaring canons, but now only
        these three can be witnessed. Made of a mixture of five metals, the canons could shoot as much as 12 kilometres
        into the sea, as word of mouth goes.

        The Murud Janjira Fort has two significant doorways. The main entrance faces the jetty from where boats ferry
        people to and fro. This sizeable arched gate is flanked with motifs of mighty animals. On one side there were
        six elephants trapped by one tiger in its claws, and on the other side, two giant elephants were locking tusks
        as two lions stood at the side. The entranceway takes you to court or Durbar Hall which used to be a three-story
        structure, now a ruin. The other doorway to the west called the 'Darya Darwaza', which opens into the sea and
        was probably used as an emergency escape back in the days.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">History</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The history of Murud
        Janjira fort goes way back to the 15th century when some local fishermen of Rajapuri built a small wooden fort
        called Medhekot on a massive rock out in the sea to save themselves and their families from the attack of
        pirates. However, the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmednagar wanted it to make one of his strongholds, firstly because
        of the vast area and secondly because of its strategic positions.

        As per the Sultan's wish, a general called Piram Khan captured the fort and Malik Ambar - the Abyssinian regent
        of Siddi origin and administrative spokesman of him ordered the construction of a solid rock fortress in place
        of the wooden garrison. After massive scale renovations to create an impregnable structure by Piram Khan's
        successor Burhan Khan, the fort was named Jazeere Mahroob Jazeera. Today's name Janjira is a broken down
        derivation of this Arabic word Jazeera which means island - it is a reference to its offshore location. Murud is
        a Konkani word, probably referring to the Shahi of Ahmednagar.

        The Murud-Janjira fort stands an unconquered one as over the years the Maratha, the Portuguese and even the
        mighty British tried and failed to breach the walls of this sea fort. The Siddi overlords became so powerful
        here that they withstood every attack and defied the sovereign itself to establish a Sultanate of Janjira..</p>
