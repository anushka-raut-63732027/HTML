    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Shaniwar Wada,Pune</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Shaniwarwada, once
        the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a 286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of
        architecture in the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Maharashtra. This grand
        mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently
        covers an area of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the city itself. The place never
        fails to amaze the visitor with its various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that
        greets the visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was destroyed by an unexplained fire
        in 1828, what remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic.

        The Shaniwar Wada, although ridden with tales of treachery and deceit, is one of the last standing testimonies
        to the grandeur, valour, and the just rule of the Peshwas. The entire old part of the city of Pune is laid out
        in a chaotic yet ironically, orderly fashion all around this historical structure. It is around Shaniwar Wada
        that you will find the oldest markets of Pune including Laxmi Road, Tulshibaug, Ravivar Peth etc. It is said
        that on a full moon night the fort is haunted by the ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered
        in the palace by his aunt and uncle - Anandi and Raghunathrao. However, there is not a shred of evidence to
        support such claims. So, you can get a glimpse of history and some drama as well! This was after all the site of
        the famed romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of the gates has also been named after
        her!</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">History</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The Shaniwar Wada
        was built by Bajirao I in the 18th century. Bajirao served as the Peshwa or the Prime Minister to the Maratha
        ruler- Chhatrapati Sahu. The palace was at first supposed to be a massive 7-storey stone structure, but after
        the completion of the base floor, much hue and cry arose. The people objected to the construction on the grounds
        of the fact that stone palaces could be sanctioned and built only be the king and not by his Peshwa. Following
        this, it was decided that the remaining building would be constructed in brick, and not stone.

        Shaniwar Wada was finally completed, but little did anyone know that the monument would witness some murky and
        horrifying times in the days to come. 90 years later, the palace was attacked by the British Artillery, which
        caused the entire six storeys to collapse and fall. Only the stone base remained to testify the grandeur and
        glory of the period passed. On February 27 in 1828, a great mysterious fire started inside the compound. The
        fire that raged on for seven days razed the entire palace to the ground and what remained were large granite
        ramparts and ruins of the buildings, along with a few strong teak gateways.</p>
