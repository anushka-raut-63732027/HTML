    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Located off the
        coast of Maharashtra, the Sindhudurg Fort is an ancient fortress occupying an islet in the Arabian Sea. This
        imposing construction is spread over an area of 48 acres, with its massive walls standing tall against the
        crashing waves of the sea. The main entrance of the fort is hidden away in such a manner that no one can
        identify it from the outside. The Sindhudurg Fort is a tangible example of the Maratha foresight and
        resourcefulness. Not only is this mighty fort a historically significant attraction, but the natural beauty of
        the surrounding landscape makes it a popular tourist spot. Protruding right from the midst of the mighty Arabian
        Sea, this fort makes up for a delightfully charming sight. Its rich historical background only adds to the
        experience of this place.

        Built by none other than Chhatrapati Shivaji, the construction of Sindhudurg Fort utilizes the natural
        protection of the surrounding rocks to their advantage. With its solid walls and conspicuous gateways, this fort
        is a fascinating piece of history which makes it a favourite tourist spot. Perhaps one of the reasons why this
        magnificent fort has managed to stand the test of time would be its unique and unyielding construction style.
        The foundation of the mighty building was laid down in the lead, and the natural protection provided by the
        surrounding rocks acted as an impregnable barrier against any enemy forces. Sindhudurg Fort also has 42
        bastions, which still stand tall and is surrounded by several smaller forts such as the Padmagad, Rajkot and
        Sarjekot Fort. A small temple dedicated to the Chhatrapati also finds a place within the bounds of the fort.</p>

    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Sindhudurg Fort was
        initially under the command of the Maratha Empire till 1765. It was commissioned for construction by
        Chhattrapati Shivaji with the purpose of providing protection against the rising influence of the English,
        Dutch, French and Portuguese merchants, and to curb the rise of Siddis of Janjira. The construction of the same
        was done under the watchful eyes of Hirojee Indulkar sometime around 1664. Later on, it was overthrown by the
        British and was re-named, Port Augustus. It was then handed over to the Marathas, and finally, in 1792 it came
        under British rule, as per their treaty with the Marathas. The fort offers a spectacular view of the surrounding
        landscape, and you will surely feel the enigma of the stories surrounding this great fort.</p>
