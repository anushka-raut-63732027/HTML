    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:black">Elephanta caves,
        Mumbai</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">A UNESCO World
        Heritage Site, Elephanta Caves is a specimen of rock-cut art and architecture from the times of medieval India.
        The caves are located on the Elephanta or Gharapuri island which is situated at a distance of 11 km from the
        city of Mumbai. Natively known as Gharapurichi Leni, the Elephanta Caves that exist today are ruins of what were
        once elaborately painted artworks. It also provides an amazing view of the Mumbai skyline. You can reach the
        Elephanta Caves via a ferry ride from Gateway of India. This collection of cave temples dates back to 5th to 7th
        centuries and most of them are dedicated to Lord Shiva.There are two groups of alcoves in the site of the
        Elephanta Caves, the first is a large group of five Hindu caves and the second one is a smaller group of two
        Buddhist caves. The Hindu caves contain the stone sculptures representing the Shaiva Hindu sect. The caves are
        an expression of art and a number of important imageries are sculpted here, which include 'Trimurti' or
        three-headed Shiva, 'Gangadhar' which is a manifestation of the river Ganga as she descends to the earth and
        'Ardhnareshwar', which is a representation of Shiva and Parvati in the same body. In addition to being an
        important heritage site, the Elephanta Caves are also an unlikely trekking destination.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:black;">History</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The history of the
        Elephanta Caves has no solid proofs and is based on a number of inferences drawn from speculations and
        postulations. It is believed that the Elephanta Caves were built by Pandavas, however, some also credit the same
        to Banasura, the demon devotee of Shiva. Local tradition dictates that the caves were not built by the hands of
        men at all.Historians date the Elephanta Caves back to late 5th - 8th century AD but excavations of Kshatrapa
        coins dated to 4th century AD have also been unearthed here. Records are available from the defeat of the
        Mauryan rulers of Konkan by the Badami Chalukyas emperor Pulakesi II. At that time, Elephanta was known as Puri
        or Purika and was the capital of the Konkan Mauryas. As a result of this, some historians believe that the caves
        were built by them during their reign.Other historians have attributed the caves to the Kalachuris who are
        believed to have some relationship with the Konkan Mauryas. These assumptions are based on the fact that the
        Elephanta caves are dedicated to Pashupata Shaivismsect, a sect to which Kalachuris as well as Konkan Mauryas
        belonged. Other than these, the Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas are also believed to have been behind the creation of
        these magnificent caves.
        Following the rule of the Chalukyas, Elephanta Caves fell into the hands of the Gujarat Sultanate, who
        surrendered it to the Portuguese in 1534. The Portuguese renamed the island as "Elephanta Island" due to the
        huge stone statue of an elephant that was situated near the island. Elephanta Caves saw major deterioration
        under the Portuguese until 1661, when the caves came under the territory of the British.
        The main cave was restored in the 1970s but the other caves are still in a very deplorable condition. The
        Elephanta Caves got featured in UNESCO's list of World Heritage Site in 1987 and became an even more popular
        tourist destination after that.</p>
