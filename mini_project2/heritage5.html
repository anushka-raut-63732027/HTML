        Terminus, Mumbai</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Chhatrapati Shivaji
        Terminus (CST), formerly known, Victoria Terminus, is a modern yet archaic railway station in the bustling
        capital city of Maharashtra - Mumbai. The marvellous structure is the perfect example of the Victorian-Gothic
        style of architecture in India and was built in 1878. In fact, the railway station, which still functions as
        usual, waas a World Heritage Site under UNESCO in 1997. The station is always bustling with the sounds of the
        metro city and the locals. It is a bustling railway terminus, but there are some corners of it that will make
        you feel like you have stepped into the pages of British history.It is one of the most famous historical
        landmarks in the country that is also the second most photographed monument in India.

        Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was constructed in 1887 and it currently functions as the headquarters of the
        Central Railways. It is well-connected to all the parts of the country as it serves as a station for
        long-distance as well as short-distance or commuter trains which are often called local trains. The architecture
        of the terminus is what draws most people to it. The night lights up the station and it looks even prettier.
        It was here that the famous song 'Jai Ho' from Slumdog Millionaire and some marvellous scenes for the Bollywood
        Movie Ra One were shot.</p>

    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The Chhatrapati
        Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (SCT) , then known as Victoria Terminus, was built on a piece of land which, at that
        time, served as a warehouse to store goods that were either exported from or imported to Mumbai. It was only in
        1853 that a railway station was built and was referred to as the Bori Bandar Railway Station. The first ever
        passenger train that operated in India was from Bori Bandar to Thane in 1853. In 1878, it was decided that the
        railway station will be rebuilt as Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Queen's Golden Jubilee and the Bori
        Bandar Railway station was officially known as Victoria Terminus in 1887.

        The terminus was designed by a British architect with the name F.W. Stevens who created an eclectic melange of
        Indian and British Architecture in his designs. The terminus was a major hub of mercantile activities and was
        named after Queen Victoria who ruled India during that period. It took ten years to complete the construction of
        the structure and cost over 260,000 Sterling Pounds. With this expenditure, it was known as the most expensive
        structure in the city of Mumbai.

        In 1996, the Minister of Railways renamed it as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and is coded as CSMT or CST
        (Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus). Mumbai also witnessed a terrorist attack in 2008 and CST was on the hit list. As
        time passed by, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus stood the tests of time for over 130 years and continues to be
        the lifeline of Mumbai.</p>
