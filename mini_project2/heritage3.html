    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The Gateway of
        India is, without doubt, one of the most popular tourist hotspots of Mumbai. Sitting proudly on the Apollo
        Bunder, it overlooks the Arabian Sea. It is one of the defining monuments of the city of Mumbai and was built in
        the year 1924. The construction was undertaken by the famous architect George Wittet, to commemorate the visit
        of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai. The imposing structure of the monument is a beautiful confluence of
        Indian, Arabic and Western architecture and has become a popular tourist hub in the city. It is also the
        starting point of a number of ferry services that ply to the historic Elephanta Caves.

        Nicknamed 'Mumbai's Taj Mahal', the foundation of this landmark was laid in 1911 and it was inaugurated 13 years
        later in 1924. The structure in itself is a made of yellow basalt and solid concrete and is embellished with
        numerous Muslim and Hindu motifs as well. The basalt arch of the Gateway served as the entry and exit access to
        India through waterways before independence and was the exit point from where the last British ship left India
        for England. There are statues of Swami Vivekananda and Chhatrapati Shivaji that have been installed near the
        Gateway as well. The view from the sea of the Gateway complex, especially at night is quite ethereal and
        beautiful. The Gateway of India is thus, not only a historic artefact but an example of marvellous architecture
        in itself!.</p>

    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The land on which
        the Gateway now stands once belonged to a jetty that was primarily used by the fishing community of the area.
        Seeing its viability as a landing area, it was renovated to serve as a pier for British governors. Soon enough,
        it was decided that a grand gateway will be built here to welcome King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai, and
        the foundation of the same was laid down March 31, 1913, by the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke.
        However, the final design of the Gateway was only sanctioned on March 31, 1914, by George Wittet. The
        constructions formally began in 1920 and it took almost four years to complete the construction of the monument.
        On 4 December 1924, the Gateway of India was inaugurated by the Viceroy, the Earl of Reading. .</p>
