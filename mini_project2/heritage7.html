    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Jaigad Fort, also
        known as the Fort of Victory, is a 16th-century fort that extends over an area of 13 acres in the coastal region
        of Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. Located near Jaigad Village and approximately 20 kms to the north-west of
        Ganpatipule, the remains of the fort stand steady on a cliff overlooking the Jaigad creek where River Shastri
        enters the vast and mesmerising Arabian Sea. Jaigad Fort is an engineering marvel for the purpose it was built.
        A glance at the magnificent structure before you enter will surely amaze you. A visit to the Jaigad lighthouse
        which was built in close vicinity to the Jaigad fort is a must.

        Jaigad Fort is considered as one of the chief ports on the Western Coast of India. It is also said that the
        mighty fort was built along with another fort named the Vijaygad Fort in order to protect the creek; with the
        Vijaygad Fort to the North and the Jaigad Fort to the South of the creek. The intelligence and brilliant
        planning put together in the era the Jaigad Fort was built in is commendable considering the limited
        availability of resources they had. Now, the fort comes under the Archaeological Survey of India and most of the
        ruins are studied by them.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">History</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">The Jaigad fort was
        built by the Bijapur Sultanate who was incapable of retaining their power in the region and lost the fort to the
        Naiks belonging to Sangameshwar. The Naiks, at that time, controlled over 600 troops and owned about 8 villages.
        While the glorious fort was under their command, they were attacked by the Portuguese and also the Bijapur
        Sultanate, but the Naiks fought fiercely and were successful in protecting it. Subsequently, the region became a
        part of the Shivaji dominion and was managed by Balaji Vishwanath Peshwa who surrendered it to Kanhoji Angre in
        1713. In 1818 however, the Jaigad fort was captured by the British during the third Anglo Maratha War.

        Some believe that many attempts were made to build the majestic fort but in vain. It was only after a human
        sacrifice that it was entirely constructed. The young boy, Jaiba Malhar, who sacrificed his life willingly, is
        believed to be resting in one of the ramparts of the fort. The name "Jaigad" was thus derived from the young
        boy's name.</p>
