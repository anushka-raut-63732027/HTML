    <p style="font-size:small;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Located around 99
        km from the town of Aurangabad, lie the Ajanta Caves now included in the list of UNESCO World heritage Sites.
        Ajanta caves depict the Buddhist culture and their stories through various sculptures and paintings. It also
        takes you to the world of Jatakas.

        The Ajanta caves is a set of 3rock-cutut Buddhist caves that date back to the period between 2nd century BC and
        650 CE. The Ajanta caves are considered one of the most prestigious monuments of India as they house many
        beautiful paintings and sculptures depicting the rich cultural heritage of India. Naturally used as a retreat by
        the Buddhist monks, the cave depicts the serenity of Buddhism through its simple yet breathtaking sculpture. The
        basic designs of the caves are called 'Chaityagrihas' & 'viharas'. Figurines of Lord Buddha and scenes from the
        traditional Jataka tales are the mainstays of this place. The area used to be heavily forested and the caves
        fell out of social conscience before being rediscovered by a British hunting officer in 1819.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">History</h1>
    <p style="font-size:small;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">Ajanta caves are
        essentially Buddhist monasteries of the bygone era. It is a place where Buddhist monks lived, studied and
        prayed. The Ajanta caves were first found by a few British soldiers in the 19th century when they were out
        hunting and one of them happened to lay his eyes on a cave covered with bushes, leaves and stones. The soldiers
        made their way into the cave and found many caves with such history in them. They informed the Government and
        ever since Ajanta caves are being excavated and studied to this day. It was declared a World Heritage Site in
        1983. The caves have been built in two phases: Satvahana followed by Vakataka period named so after the ruling
        dynasty. The first phase lasted from 100B CE to 100 CE, when the sanctuaries were built in the canyons of the
        Waghora river and called Chaitya-griha. Caves 9, 10, 12, 15A are from this period. During the second phase,
        around 20 cave temples were built which resemble modern day monasteries with a sanctum in the rear end of the
        cave./p>
