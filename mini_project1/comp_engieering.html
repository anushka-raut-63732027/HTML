                <p style="font-size:medium;font-family: cursive;text-align: justify;"><strong>The Department of Computer
                        Engineering offers a four-year B.Tech programme in Computer Engineering with the aim to provide
                        a sound grounding in the fundamentals of computing and understanding of the underlying
                        engineering principles. Computer engineering blends computer science and emerging Technologies
                        to further the advancements in digital technology, computer networking and computer systems.
                        Computer engineering principles can be applied to several other purposes, including the
                        development of integrated circuits, embedded systems, computer vision, computer systems
                        architecture, and much more. In turn, computer engineers use their extensive knowledge of
                        hardware and software design and computer programming to make computing platforms and
                        applications more efficient and effective. This course aims at providing intensive information
                        in areas of computer systems, distributed systems, internet of things, Robotics, Computer
                        networks and Wireless networks & communication. By studying this course, the students will have
                        an opportunity to learn tools and techniques to work on the related fields such as robotics,
                        cyber security, and computer-aided design systems. The curriculum of this programme was revised
                        based on the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) and implemented in the academic year
                        2014-15.</strong>
